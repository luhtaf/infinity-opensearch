## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtual environment (`venv`) for managing dependencies

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luhtaf/infinity-opensearch.git
cd infinity-opensearch/api_elastic
```

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### Activate the Virtual Environment

- For Linux/MacOS:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
### Activate the Virtual Environment

- For Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file from the provided example:

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

Edit config.yaml and provide your OpenSearch URL, username, and password:

```yaml
opensearch:
  url: "https://your-opensearch-url.com/api/elastic/"
  username: "<your_username>"
  password: "<your_password>"
```

Make sure to replace your_username and your_password with your actual OpenSearch credentials.

## Running the Application

To start the Flask API, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start in development mode and listen on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Notes

- Ensure that your OpenSearch instance is accessible and that the credentials provided in `config.yaml` are correct.
- The endpoint uses OpenSearchâ€™ API and filters data based on the `@timestamp` field. Adjust your queries accordingly based on your OpenSearch index mappings.
- If you encounter any errors, check the logs in your Flask application for more details.
